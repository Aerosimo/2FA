### PROJECT OVERVIEW

# 2FA
> *Multi-factor authentication or 2FA is an electronic authentication method in which a 
user is granted access to a website or application only after successfully presenting two 
or more pieces of evidence (or factors) to an authentication mechanism. knowledge 
(something only the user knows), possession (something only the user has), and inherence 
(something only the user is). MFA protects user data—which may include personal identification 
or financial assets—from being accessed by an unauthorised third party that may have been able 
to discover, for example, a single password.*

### MFA AUTHENTICATION MODULE
 
> *Authentication is the act of proving an assertion, such as the identity of a computer system user. In contrast with identification, the act of indicating a person or thing's identity, authentication is the process of verifying that identity.*
 
> *Security system authentication application is designed to provide a two-layer login procedure for any applications. Most of the login security methods procedures which are password-based login, OTP based login, and login and OTP combined authentication procedure. These methods can provide login security for users to a certain level but some application requires more authenticated methods which are mainly useful for banking and payments methods. In this project, two-layer login methods are developed which have password login and OTP login.  In this application when a user registers with the application user fills the registration form which is stored in a database. Whenever user logins to the application first user need to give a password if that is correct second stage OTP is given then the user can log in to the application..*

###### OBJECTIVES:

> *The main objective of the two-level security system is to provide advanced security to web applications and to prevent unauthorized access. Text passwords are the most commonly used technique for authentication and have several drawbacks.*

###### FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:

> - **User can Register (Signup)**
> - **User can Retrieve Password**
> - **User can Reset Password**
> - **User can Login (Signin)**
> - **User can Logout (Signout)**
